x Do not fetch content if click on node tied to already opened note.
x Do not save a newly loaded note.

x Dispatch click node on app load to select the last opened note
x refactor the "add node and select" action.
x Add new note would present a blank page on Editor
x To fix: with folder node selected, switching to a note would fetch *and* save.  No save should be performed.

x Add created date and modified date to editor content
x To fix: Loading/switching note triggers a content change, triggers refresh of modified date and consequently a save.
    => Fixed by changing Editor from controlled to uncontrolled. So now loading a note would rerender the Editor instead of triggering a content-change action.
x Save newly created note
x The saved note title should appear on corresponding node.
Active node should be the persistent.
Upon creation of new note, auto select editor body.
delete node deletes note in DB, and other necessary operations.
? Deselecting note with empty content deletes the note.
Retry save or load on failure
recycle bin
